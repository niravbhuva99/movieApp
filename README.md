# movieApp
I built this app using the Movie API. You can see a list of the most popular movies i.e. H. the 20 best movies and the best TV shows.
By clicking “See All” you can see all movies and TV shows.
If you want to go back, you can go back by clicking <.
If you want another movie, you can search it in search bar.
and You can get an overview with animations if you move the mouse over the image.
